Sorting
=========

In this homework you are asked to implement four sorting algorithms:
`bubblesort`, `mergesort`, `quicksort`, and one additional sort
algorithm of your choosing, which I'll call `mystery_sort`.

The Shaffer text describes all of these algorithms, among many
others. The Internet is replete with examples and full
implementations.

Be careful when deciding which additional algorithm to implement. Some
of them are really tricky.
